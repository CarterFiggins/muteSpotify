# muteSpotify
Mutes spotify ads on the browser

I personaly think that spotify ads are ment to drive you crazy into buying spotify perimium. I wrote this scriped to stop the pain.
Now instead of anoying ads I get the sound of silence. :D

It works by checking the html tags. If the targeted tag appears it will mute spotify by clicking the mute button and when the ad is
gone it unmutes it. 

I use [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) to enject the script onto the page everytime spotify is loaded. It is a chrome plugin that you can download.
