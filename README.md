# muteSpodify
Mutes spodify ads on the browser

I personaly think that spodify ads are ment to drive you crazy into buying spodify perimium. I wrote this scriped to stop the pain.
Now instead up anoying ads I get the sound of silence. :D

It works by checking the html tags. If the targeted tag appears it will mute spodify by clicking the mute button and when the ad is
gone it unmutes it. 

I use Tampermonkey to enject the script onto the page everytime spodify is loaded. It is a chrome plugin that you can download.
